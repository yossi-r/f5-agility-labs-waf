Lab 1.1: Creation of an AWAF base policy
=========================================

We’re going to be working in the BIG-IP to create an ASM template with some specific settings applied that we can use on our VS.  
Once the template is created, we’ll use AS3 and Postman to add an ASM policy to a VS based on our template to show how to add automation of ASM policies to applications.  

1.1.1 Open RDP to the Client linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**For users with Mac's, keystrokes won't show as you type.  Don't worry, just keep typing and login.**

Log into the BIG-IP by opening the FireFox browser in the Linux client and selecting the browser bookmark titled :guilabel:`bigip01` using the following credentials:

        Username:	:guilabel:`admin`
    
        Password:	:guilabel:`f5DEMOs4u!`

1.1.3 Create a policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let’s create an AWAF base policy that we’ll reference later, by navigating to:
		
		Security  ››  Application Security : Security Policies : Policies List

            Click ‘Create’

1.1.4 Configure policy properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#Please fix all guilabel tags below. They are not rendering correctly in the remainder of this file

Name the policy :guilabel:`base_policy` and set the following settings:
       
 policy Name:                                            :guilabel:`base_policy` 

 Policy Template:                                        :guilabel:`Rapid Deployment Policy`   

 Enforcement Mode:                                       :guilabel:`Blocking`     

 Auto-Added Signature Accuracy:                          :guilabel:`Medium`  

 Signature Staging:                                      :guilabel:`Disabled` 

 Policy is Case Sensitive:                               :guilabel:`Disabled` 

 Differentiate between HTTP/WS and HTTPS/WSS URLs:       :guilabel:`Disabled`  
 
Click :guilabel:`Save` to save the policy

1.1.5 Block traffic from North Korea
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Navigate to:  Security  ››  Application Security : Geolocation Enforcement

        We’re going to create a Geo enforcement on this policy to block North Korea form accessing our site.  
        From the ‘Allowed Geolocations’ on the right, find ‘Korea, Democratic People’s Republic of’ and bring it to the left window titled ‘Disallowed Geolocations’:

        .. image:: images/5-module1.png


        Click :guilabel:`Save` 

    Navigate to:  ‘Security  ››  Application Security : Policy Building : Learning and Blocking Settings

        If you expand :guilabel:`IP Addresses and Geolocations` you’ll notice that we’re enforcing blocking of the Geolocation that we created in the previous step as well as access from known malicious IP addresses.

        .. image:: images/6-module1.png
    
    On this same screen, under the section :guilabel:`File types` check the boxes on :guilabel:`Illegal file type` to ‘learn’, ‘alarm’, and ‘block’ as shown below.
